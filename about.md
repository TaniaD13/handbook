## Why should I care?

The point of making these decisions is to make sure that we are all on the same page, and that we can easily understand what was intended when we look at code in the future. 

Secondly, each project should stylistically look simliar. This maintains consistency across projects with multiple developers and makes future maintenance/enhancements easier as there is less ramp up for any one developer.

We're not trying to come up with the perfect way to design, the idea is to deliberately make these decisions as a team so we aren't all making different decisions individually.

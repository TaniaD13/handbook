# About Hypenotic

Hypenotic is a founding Canadian B Corp on a mission to manifest a more **Generative Economy**. Beyond sustainable, a **Generative** approach looks for opportunities to spark other positive returns. Since 1998, weâ€™ve worked with brands who take the impact of how they make their margins into account. We help them use their mission to inform their marketing strategies and tactics. 

## What's this?

This handbook is an attempt at codifying our most recent thinking and processes. The contents of this handbook will change often, but the point of making these decisions is to make sure that we are all on the same page, and that we can easily understand what was intended for any project. 

We're not trying to come up with the perfect system, the idea is to deliberately make these decisions as a team so we aren't all making different decisions individually.

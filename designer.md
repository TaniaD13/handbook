* [Why should I care?](#why-should-i-care)
* [Design tools we use](#development-tools-we-use)
* [Workflow](#git-workflow)
* [Best Practices](#best-practices)

## Why should I care?

We're not trying to come up with the perfect way to design, the idea is to deliberately make these decisions as a team so we aren't all making different decisions individually. 

## Development tools we use

* Photoshop 
* Wireframing
* Sketch
* Macaw
* White board
* Typekit


* Designing in the browser
* 80/20 rule
* Visual inventory

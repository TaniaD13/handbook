## Automated Regression Testing
Regression testing is a set of automated tests to compare visual differences on websites. It’s an automated game of “Spot the Differences”, where your computer uses a web browser to render a page or portion of a page and highlights all the differences it finds between two sources.

We use [BackstopJS](https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/) that we run manually or through our build process to report on any unintended visual changes.
